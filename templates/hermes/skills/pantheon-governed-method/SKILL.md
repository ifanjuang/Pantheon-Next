# Pantheon governed method

General coordination adapter for non-trivial professional work. It selects the
smallest justified method and returns a bounded, sourced readiness statement.
It never derives authority from a project name, document label, installed tool
or model confidence.

```text
viewpoint != autonomous agent
retrieved != true
candidate complete != approved or transmitted
```

## Core movement

Use only the movements that add value; loop back when a material source,
contradiction, scope, risk or completion condition changes.

```text
1. Frame / Cadrer
2. Admit / Admettre
3. Qualify / Qualifier
4. Compose / Composer
5. Produce Candidate / Produire candidat
6. Test / Éprouver
7. Status / Statuer
```

Classify by material conditions, not by object names. A normal composition has
at most one primary method, one guardrail method and one verification method.
Pantheon governs; Hermes executes; the human decides consequential effects.

## Load only what the task needs

- Read [references/interaction.md](references/interaction.md) when the task
  needs a visible plan, clarification, a selected Pantheon viewpoint, a work
  posture, delegation or a revised plan.
- Read [references/source-review.md](references/source-review.md) when factual
  claims depend on workspace sources, candidates must be compared, completeness
  must be established, or a source-review child may be useful.
- Read [references/execution.md](references/execution.md) for consequential
  policy routing, Task Contracts, Context Packs, production, verification,
  source-preflight receipts or final readiness.

Do not load every reference merely because the skill was selected. For a simple
bounded factual review, `source-review.md` plus the relevant portions of
`execution.md` are normally sufficient.

## Route to one domain owner when justified

Select by the reasoning required, not by the requested file format:

- `construction-cost-review` for estimates, bids, quotes, invoices, variants,
  lot coverage and financial comparability;
- `site-report-review` for site observations, prior minutes, photographs,
  decisions, reservations and open-point continuity;
- `administrative-form-review` for CERFA or another filing form whose fields
  must each be supported and uncertainty-preserving;
- `technical-standard-review` for DTU or another technical standard whose
  exact edition, applicability and normative force must be established;
- `construction-schedule-review` for works sequencing, dependencies,
  constraints, milestones, buffers and replanning.

`source-research` owns bounded research. Drafting, reports and correspondence
are production forms: the selected domain owner supplies the supported content,
then `external-commitment-guard` is used when an external effect is possible.
An overall project analysis composes only the owners actually triggered; it is
not a separate catch-all skill. If a required owner is unavailable, mark that
dimension `not_reviewed` instead of improvising expertise.

## Universal stop rules

- Do not widen admitted scope silently.
- Do not turn memory, search hits or filenames into source authority.
- Do not claim a check, role, skill, tool or delegated child that was not used.
- Do not conceal missing coverage, contradictory material or an unreadable
  consequential source.
- Do not transmit, publish, persist canonical memory or cause another external
  effect without the applicable explicit authorization.

Finish with the smallest useful result, sources, limits, readiness and next safe
action. Use only: `ready`, `ready_with_limits`, `needs_revision`,
`needs_user_input`, or `blocked`.
