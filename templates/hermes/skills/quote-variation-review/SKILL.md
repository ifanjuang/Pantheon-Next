# Quote variation review (governed candidate)

Non-executable candidate skill in the `agentskills.io` / `SKILL.md` standard, so a
Hermes Agent can load it. Pantheon governs; Hermes executes outside the repo.

## When to use
A complementary quote adds a plus-value whose amount or scope is unclear or may not
reconcile with a prior signed amendment. Produce a candidate opinion and a draft, not
a decision.

## Governed boundary
- Allowed outputs: candidate opinion; point to verify; amount/scope discrepancy note;
  capability gap.
- Forbidden: approving the quote; final payment advice; external send; "quote
  validated"; promoting a Registre Probatoire entry.
- A discrepancy is returned as a point to verify, not a decision. `forged != authorized`.
