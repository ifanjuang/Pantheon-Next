"""Tripwire: curated canonical governance files must not be silently truncated.

A recurring failure mode (see ai_logs/2026-06-26-modules-index-runtime-review-and-
truncation-repair.md) is a connector returning a *partial* read of a long file,
which is then written back as a full-file replacement — silently dropping the tail.

This check fails CI when a curated file falls below its reviewed minimum line count
or loses its required end-sentinel. The thresholds describe the current intentional
shape of each curated file, not a requirement that doctrine stay verbose. If a file
legitimately converges to a smaller owner map, update the manifest in the same PR.

It does not edit, fix or rewrite anything. It only reports.
