"""Generic tripwire: a long governance doc must not be silently truncated.

`check_no_truncation.py` protects a small, hand-curated MANIFEST of files by
absolute length and end-sentinel. This check generalizes the *class* of defect
it was built for — a connector returning a partial read that is written back as
a full-file replacement, silently dropping the tail (see
ai_logs/2026-06-26-modules-index-runtime-review-and-truncation-repair.md and the
AUTHORITY_INDEX.md truncation introduced by commit 094d0a9) — to *every* long
governance Markdown file, without needing each one enumerated in advance.

It compares each modified `docs/governance/**/*.md` file against the PR base
(GOVERNANCE_BASE_REF). A file that was long at the base and loses a large,
disproportionate share of its lines is flagged as a probable truncation.

The intent is to catch the *additive-commit-that-secretly-deletes* shape: an
edit whose purpose is to add (index a doc, add a section) but whose net effect
is a big deletion — intent and effect disagree.

It does not edit, fix or rewrite anything. It only reports.

Deliberate shrinks (a real split, a real removal) are legitimate. Acknowledge
them explicitly by adding the file's repo-relative path to
`.github/scripts/truncation_ack.txt`; that edit is itself a reviewable signal.
