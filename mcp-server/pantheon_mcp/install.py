"""Read-only install / liveness verification.

Given evidence already gathered about a component install — a log excerpt, a
health probe result and check results — this classifies the install state and
returns the verdict as data: is it installed, does it answer, are its checks
green. It performs **no probe**, makes **no NAS access**, installs nothing and
decides nothing. The gate and the human decide.

This is the read-only verification brain the dashboard surface displays: the
dashboard "verifies installs from their logs and liveness", and this turns the
provided evidence into a structured verdict. When evidence is insufficient it
reports a capability gap rather than improvising a conclusion.

Evidence shape (every field optional; all values are *provided*, never fetched)::

    component: langfuse-hermes
    installed: true                 # or omit and supply the markers below
    installed_markers: [".../VERSION"]      # presence taken as installed
    install_success_markers: ["bootstrap complete"]   # matched in logs
    logs: "...log excerpt..."
    health: { reachable: true, status_code: 200, latency_ms: 42 }
    checks:
      - { name: health, status: green }
      - { name: ready, status: green }
    expected_checks: [health, ready]        # must all be present and green
