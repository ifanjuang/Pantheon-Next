"""Read-only exposure-surface verification.

Where the other verifications ask whether a component is installed, observable or
recoverable, this asks whether its **exposure surface is safe**: how far it is
reachable (local / VPN / public), whether authentication is enforced and whether
access scope is limited. The doctrine is explicit that internal runtimes must not
be reachable publicly without protection, and that a public surface must stay
authenticated and least-privilege. A publicly reachable surface with no auth is
the unsafe extreme this surfaces as a distinct read-only verdict.

It classifies *provided* evidence only: it performs no probe, makes no NAS
access, opens no port, sends nothing and decides nothing. Insufficient evidence
is reported as a capability gap rather than improvised. The gate and the human
decide.

Evidence shape (every field optional; all values are *provided*, never fetched)::

    component: openwebui
    reach: public            # local | vpn | public
    auth: { enforced: true }
    scope: { limited: true }   # read-only / least-privilege
