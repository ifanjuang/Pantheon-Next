"""Read-only backup / recoverability verification.

Where `verify_install` asks "is it installed and answering" and
`verify_observability` asks "can we even see it", this asks the recovery
question: **if it dies, can we get it back** — does a backup exist, is it recent,
and has a restore actually been demonstrated. A backup that exists but is stale,
or has never been restored, is not recoverability; and "we have backups" with no
restore test is the classic false comfort. This is the baseline the bootstrap
chain blocks on before any substrate or runtime.

It classifies *provided* evidence only: it performs no probe, makes no NAS
access, runs no backup or restore and decides nothing. Insufficient evidence is
reported as a capability gap rather than improvised. The gate and the human
decide.

Evidence shape (every field optional; all values are *provided*, never fetched)::

    component: registre-probatoire
    present: true                       # or omit and supply backup_markers
    backup_markers: [".../snapshot-2026-06-22"]
    freshness: { last_backup_age_s: 3600, max_age_s: 86400 }
    restore: { verified: true }
