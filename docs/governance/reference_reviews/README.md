# External Reference Reviews

Status: support doctrine index — reference review navigation only.

This directory contains detailed reviews of external systems before any Pantheon distillation, external-runtime binding, client selection or governed Cockpit projection is considered.

It does not approve dependencies.
It does not approve integrations.
It does not define runtime behavior.

Current responsibility split:

```text
Compatible runtime clients -> optional runtime interaction surfaces
Hermes Agent               -> external execution candidate/binding where useful
Pantheon Cockpit           -> governed projection where useful
Pantheon Next              -> governance distillation and authority boundaries
Human                      -> consequential decision when required
```

A reference may concern only one of these layers. Reviewing a product does not create a missing layer merely to give that product somewhere to live.

## Review rule

Every external reference should be reviewed against the smallest existing responsibility it could improve:

```text
Pantheon governance -> useful governance pattern, forbidden imports and existing destination owner
Hermes/runtime       -> executable capability candidate only when the capability is demonstrated and bounded
Runtime client       -> replaceable interaction surface only when a distinct interaction need exists
Pantheon Cockpit     -> governed projection pattern only when a distinct projection need exists
```

If the useful pattern already has an owner, distill into that owner rather than creating a product-specific path. If no demonstrated capability gap remains, keep the reference historical or refuse it.

```text
reviewed != adopted
compatible != selected
selected != dependency adopted
projected != authoritative
```

## Reviews

The detailed one-shot reviews formerly stored in this directory were removed on 2026-07-07 (governance cleanup, audit follow-up). Each full text remains in git history (`git log --diff-filter=D -- docs/governance/reference_reviews/` or commit `355a1b3^`). The strategic memory of each tool is kept below; the mapping trace is in `ai_logs/2026-07-07-governance-cleanup-pass-a.md`.

New reviews follow the review rule above, are distilled promptly, and the one-shot review file is removed once its distillate lands here — a review is a working document, not doctrine.

Historical rows below preserve the vocabulary and product relationships that were reviewed at the time. Those mentions are provenance, not current architecture assignments.

## Removal index — strategic memory of reviewed tools (2026-07-07)

One row per removed review. Status vocabulary: **distilled** (the useful pattern already lives in the target document), **to review** (candidate value, never distilled — re-open from git history before use), **superseded** (covered by a newer review or document). All rows: removed; git history.

## Non-adoption rule

A review may recommend:

- watch;
- distill into an existing owner;
- reject;
- keep as a bounded Hermes/runtime capability candidate;
- keep as a replaceable runtime-client candidate;
- keep as a governed Cockpit projection pattern;
- archive as historical provenance.

A review must not be treated as:

- dependency approval;
- implementation approval;
- runtime migration;
- skill installation;
- provider choice;
- memory promotion;
- approval shortcut.

## Final rule

```text
Review first.
Distill only what survives the boundary.
Reuse an existing owner before adding a product path.
Install nothing by implication.
```
