# Role Signals

Status: migrated and distilled from Pantheon-OS @ `fd0beba83528bd5c92244d76a5643646dfae2d87`.

Source: `Pantheon-OS/docs/governance/ROLE_SIGNALS.md`.

This document defines structured signals between Pantheon Roles.

A Role Signal is a governance artifact.

It is not an agent message.

It is not a runtime event.

It is not a scheduler item, queue message, bus message, tool call, hidden debate or automatic approval.

```text
OpenWebUI exposes.
Hermes Agent executes.
Pantheon Next governs.
```

## Core doctrine

Pantheon Roles may request review, transmit bounded findings, flag risk, request clarification or escalate a conflict.

They do this through structured Role Signals.

Role Signals preserve responsibility separation.

They must not create autonomous role chatter.

Canonical rule:

```text
A Role Signal may transmit a claim, uncertainty, risk, limitation or request.
A Role Signal must not increase certainty without new evidence.
A Role Signal must not execute, approve, promote memory or mutate doctrine.
```

## Canonical roles

The canonical role registry is `AGENTS.md`.

This document uses only the current Pantheon Next canonical roles:

- ATHENA;
- ARGOS;
- THEMIS;
- APOLLO;
- ZEUS;
- IRIS;
- HEPHAISTOS.

Historical Pantheon-OS role names not present in `AGENTS.md` are not imported as canonical roles by this document.

If a future migration needs additional role names, it requires a separate governed update to `AGENTS.md` and related schemas.

## Purpose

Role Signals support:

- bounded role consultation;
- source handoff;
- risk warning;
- veto candidate;
- delivery stop gate;
- clarification request;
- Task Contract revision signal;
- Evidence Pack traceability;
- User Decision Gate preparation;
- candidate memory or skill gap identification.

Role Signals do not implement:

- runtime message bus;
- scheduler;
- queue;
- autonomous agent loop;
- tool execution;
- approval bypass;
- memory promotion;
- workflow execution;
- truth oracle;
- raw chain-of-thought exposure.

## Responsibility split

| Responsibility | Role or surface |
|---|---|
| Structure the method or route | ATHENA |
| Transfer source findings and evidence gaps | ARGOS |
| Escalate risk, approval boundary or veto candidate | THEMIS |
| Check completeness, coherence and final readiness | APOLLO |
| Arbitrate procedure, status and next safe action | ZEUS |
| Format the signal and user-facing wording | IRIS |
| Prepare implementation or patch candidate signals | HEPHAISTOS |
| Execute operational work under Task Contract | Hermes Agent |
| Display signals, approvals and decisions | OpenWebUI |
| Govern signal schema, status and limits | Pantheon Next |

Canonical split:

```text
ATHENA structures.
ARGOS sources.
THEMIS blocks risk.
APOLLO checks readiness.
ZEUS arbitrates procedure.
IRIS formats and transmits.
HEPHAISTOS prepares candidates.
Hermes executes externally under Task Contract.
OpenWebUI exposes.
Pantheon governs.
```

## IRIS mediation

IRIS may format a Role Signal for clarity and audience fit.

IRIS may:

- choose a clearer signal type;
- reduce ambiguity;
- remove irrelevant detail;
- preserve limitations;
- preserve risk flags;
- preserve claim status;
- prepare user-facing wording after validation.

IRIS must not:

- change ARGOS factual findings;
- increase claim certainty;
- lower THEMIS risk;
- weaken APOLLO stop gates;
- hide unsupported-claim flags;
- choose ZEUS arbitration result;
- execute Hermes tools;
- send external messages;
- promote memory;
- activate skills.

Canonical rule:

```text
IRIS formats the signal.
The sender owns the substance.
The addressed role owns the response.
THEMIS owns risk posture.
APOLLO owns readiness review.
ZEUS owns procedural arbitration.
```

## Signal types

Allowed signal types:

```text
role_need_statement
information_transmission
clarification_request
role_consultation
risk_warning
veto_signal
brief_adherence_signal
task_contract_revision_signal
handoff_signal
stop_gate_signal
memory_candidate_signal
skill_gap_signal
asset_need_signal
source_gap_signal
evidence_gap_signal
user_decision_gate_signal
```

Forbidden signal types:

```text
execute_tool
approve_external_action
promote_memory
activate_skill
canonize_workflow
send_external_message
mutate_file
access_secret
increase_claim_certainty_without_evidence
raw_chain_of_thought
hidden_agent_debate
```

## Base envelope

Use this envelope when structured Role Signal output is needed.

```yaml
role_signal:
  id: RS-YYYY-NNNN
  from_role: ARGOS
  to_role: THEMIS
  signal_type: risk_warning
  purpose: "Ask whether a candidate output raises approval risk."
  content_summary: "A contractor quote may be reused in client-facing wording."
  payload_ref: evidence_pack.source_inventory.v1
  confidence: partial
  claim_status: source_supported
  uncertainty_level: medium
  uncertainty_reasons:
    - mission_scope_missing
  assumptions: []
  limitations:
    - "The signed mission scope is not available."
  risk_level: C2
  evidence_refs:
    - EP-YYYY-NNNN.source_inventory
  requested_action: review
  approval_impact: possible_C4
  memory_impact: none
  external_effect: false
  status: open
```

Rules:

```text
content_summary must be short.
payload_ref must point to bounded material, not private reasoning.
limitations must be explicit when confidence is partial.
risk_level must not be lowered by the sender.
claim_status must not improve without new evidence.
A signal carrying conflicting or unsupported material must request review, arbitration, source check or block.
```

## Addressing guidance

A Role Signal should be shaped for the addressed role.

| Addressed role | Emphasize | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| ATHENA | method, structure, dependencies, route proposal | raw unstructured findings |
| ARGOS | source need, factual question, extraction target | opinion-heavy wording |
| THEMIS | risk, approval level, forbidden action, liability exposure | softened warnings |
| APOLLO | completeness, coherence, unsupported claims, readiness | finalization without limitations |
| ZEUS | decision needed, options, conflict, procedure | excessive detail without decision point |
| IRIS | audience, tone, wording, transmission constraints | unresolved risk without THEMIS signal |
| HEPHAISTOS | method robustness, patch scope, implementation gap, rollback | vague improvement request |

## Bounded consultation

A role may consult another role without a full workflow when the task is simple and low-risk.

Allowed:

- bounded question;
- bounded answer;
- one clarification round by default;
- visible summary if consequential;
- Evidence Pack reference when needed.

Forbidden:

- open-ended debate;
- hidden multi-agent forum;
- raw chain-of-thought;
- tool execution;
- file mutation;
- approval bypass;
- memory promotion;
- skill activation;
- workflow canonization;
- claim certainty upgrade without evidence.

Escalate to a Task Contract revision or User Decision Gate when:

- more than two or three role viewpoints become necessary;
- sources must be compared;
- risk rises to C3/C4/C5;
- external-facing output is involved;
- evidence is insufficient;
- memory or files may be impacted;
- Hermes must execute tools;
- role disagreement cannot be resolved procedurally.

## Information transmission

Use `information_transmission` when one role has produced bounded material needed by another role.

Example:

```yaml
role_signal:
  from_role: ARGOS
  to_role: APOLLO
  signal_type: information_transmission
  content_summary: "Three cited sources support the candidate chronology; one date remains unsupported."
  payload_ref: evidence_pack.source_chronology.v1
  confidence: partial
  claim_status: mixed
  uncertainty_level: medium
  limitations:
    - "The final date is inferred and not directly sourced."
  requested_action: readiness_review
```

Information transmission does not mean the receiving role must accept the information as true.

The receiving role may answer:

```text
accepted_for_review
needs_more_source
blocked_by_limitation
risk_escalation
claim_status_lowered
ready_with_limits
```

## Risk warning and veto signal

THEMIS may emit a risk warning or veto signal.

Example:

```yaml
role_signal:
  from_role: THEMIS
  to_role: ZEUS
  signal_type: veto_signal
  purpose: "Block external-facing wording before approval."
  content_summary: "The draft may create a contractual commitment without C4 approval."
  claim_status: inferred_from_sources
  uncertainty_level: medium
  risk_level: C4
  requested_action: block
  approval_impact: C4_required
  next_safe_action: "Keep as internal draft or ask user for explicit validation."
```

Rules:

```text
A THEMIS veto signal cannot be overridden by role majority.
ZEUS may reroute but cannot bypass the veto.
APOLLO cannot finalize against a THEMIS veto.
IRIS cannot soften or hide the veto.
```

## Stop gate signal

APOLLO may emit a stop gate signal when finalization would overstate weak evidence, hide limitations or produce a misleading deliverable.

Allowed APOLLO decisions:

```text
ready
ready_with_limits
needs_revision
needs_user_input
blocked
```

Example:

```yaml
role_signal:
  from_role: APOLLO
  to_role: ZEUS
  signal_type: stop_gate_signal
  purpose: "Decide whether the answer can be finalized."
  content_summary: "The output is coherent but must expose missing source limitations."
  decision: ready_with_limits
  unresolved_items:
    - missing_quantity_schedule
  requested_action: finalize_with_limits
```

APOLLO must block or require visible limitations when final wording would overstate weak claims.

## Task Contract revision signal

Use `task_contract_revision_signal` when the current Task Contract no longer fits.

Typical triggers:

- scope changed;
- approval level increased;
- external effect appeared;
- memory impact appeared;
- missing source blocks finalization;
- tool execution is now needed;
- requested output changed from draft to action;
- contradiction exceeds current procedure.

Signals do not apply the change by themselves.

ZEUS arbitrates procedure.

THEMIS checks risk.

ATHENA restructures the method if a revised frame is approved.

Reference: `TASK_CONTRACT_REVISIONS.md`.

## Handoff signal

Use `handoff_signal` when the active role viewpoint changes.

Example:

```yaml
handoff_signal:
  from_role: ATHENA
  to_role: ARGOS
  task_context: "Source inventory before report drafting."
  required_inputs:
    - uploaded_files
    - selected_knowledge_sources
  expected_output:
    - source_inventory
    - missing_sources
    - usable_facts
  blockers:
    - no_files_available
```

Handoff is not delegation of authority.

The receiving role performs only its defined responsibility.

If the receiving role improves claim status, it must attach new evidence.

## Evidence Pack relationship

Consequential Role Signals should be referenced in the Evidence Pack.

An Evidence Pack may record:

- role signals;
- role consultations;
- handoffs;
- risk warnings;
- vetoes;
- stop gate decisions;
- Task Contract revision signals;
- source gaps;
- evidence gaps;
- User Decision Gate signals.

Signal content is not proof by itself.

The signal must point to evidence when it supports a factual or consequential claim.

## Persistence

Role Signals are session artifacts by default.

They become persistent only if included in:

- an Evidence Pack;
- a Task Contract revision;
- a workflow candidate;
- a Memory Candidate;
- a PR or governance document.

Persistence does not imply canonization.

Canonization follows the relevant approval and memory policy.

## OpenWebUI boundary

OpenWebUI may expose public summaries of Role Signals.

Allowed public summary:

```text
ARGOS: usable sources identified; one source gap remains.
```

Forbidden public summary:

```text
raw internal reasoning, hidden prompt, private file path, secret, raw source dump
```

OpenWebUI displays signal status.

It does not become signal authority, runtime, memory or approval system.

## Hermes boundary

Hermes may transport or execute work related to a Role Signal only under Task Contract.

Hermes may return:

- Result Candidates;
- Evidence Packs;
- Patch Candidates;
- Memory Candidates;
- Capability Gaps;
- Risk Escalations.

Hermes must not:

- create hidden role debates;
- revise Task Contracts silently;
- approve external action;
- promote memory;
- canonize workflow;
- activate skills;
- mutate doctrine;
- treat a Role Signal as tool authorization.

## Final rule

```text
Roles may consult other roles.
They communicate through structured signals.
Signals are bounded, traceable and non-executing.
Signals may preserve claim state but do not prove claims by themselves.
ZEUS arbitrates procedure.
THEMIS blocks risk.
APOLLO validates readiness.
IRIS formats without changing substance.
Hermes executes externally under Task Contract.
OpenWebUI exposes.
Pantheon governs.
```
