# Hindsight tag taxonomy

Status: candidate implementation contract — project-scoped Kroqi qualification.

This document is the canonical tag contract for filesystem documents retained by
the Pantheon Workspace producer in Hindsight. It defines retrieval scope and
navigation hints; it does not turn a folder, filename or memory into professional
truth.

## Principles

```text
tag = retrieval selector
metadata = provenance returned with a result
entity schema = normalized information extracted from content
page / mental model = derived synthesis
```

Only `scope:*` tags define a project-memory boundary. Other tags may narrow a
query but never authorize a cross-project recall.

The first-directory rule is evaluated below the admitted project root, currently
`/mnt/pantheon-affaires/KROQI/AFFAIRES`, never from the broader NAS share.

Tags are lowercase slugs. The producer removes accents/punctuation boundaries,
uses `-` as the separator and limits each dynamic value to 96 characters.

## Tags emitted by the Workspace producer

| Pattern | Meaning | Example | Retrieval role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace:<workspace>` | Linux-visible admitted workspace | `workspace:kroqi` | Origin/navigation |
| `source:<kind>` | Source channel configured for the producer | `source:kroqi-sync` | Origin/navigation |
| `scope:project:<project>` | Project inherited from the first directory; cartouche context is used only for a root-level document | `scope:project:mediatheque` | **Strict project boundary** |
| `scope:pending-identification` | Document has no identified project | exact fixed tag | Separate identification queue only |
| `folder:<cumulative-path>` | Cumulative folder ancestry | `folder:mediatheque-03-execution-plans` | Drill-down inside an already selected project |
| `project_hint:<project>` | Descriptive project hint carried by the card | `project_hint:mediatheque` | Display/discovery; not a boundary |
| `phase_hint:<phase>` | Descriptive phase hint | `phase_hint:dce` | Display/discovery |
| `family:<family>` | Non-authoritative filename-derived document family | `family:plan-cvc` | Find possible versions |
| `revision_hint:<revision>` | Non-authoritative explicit filename revision marker | `revision_hint:ind-b` | Version discovery only |
| `tag:<subject>` | Optional bounded source/cartouche subject tag | `tag:ossature-bois` | Thematic navigation only |

Folder tags are cumulative. For:

```text
Mediatheque/03 Execution/Plans/Plan CVC IND-B.pdf
```

the producer emits:

```text
scope:project:mediatheque
folder:mediatheque
folder:mediatheque-03-execution
folder:mediatheque-03-execution-plans
```

The project scope is therefore stable even when a user searches only one deep
subfolder.

## Hermes query contract

Hermes must resolve the active project before asking Hindsight for project
material. A normal KROQI project recall uses:

```json
{
  "tags": [
    "source:kroqi-sync",
    "scope:project:mediatheque"
  ],
  "tags_match": "all_strict"
}
```

Rules:

1. A project recall always includes exactly one `scope:project:*` tag.
2. Multiple query tags use `all_strict`; a broad `any` match is not a project
   boundary.
3. `folder:*`, `phase_hint:*`, `family:*`, `revision_hint:*` and `tag:*` may only
   narrow an already project-scoped query.
4. `project_hint:*` never substitutes for `scope:project:*`.
   When a cartouche project disagrees with the first directory, the first
   directory remains the scope and the disagreement is returned as provenance.
5. `scope:pending-identification` is queried only by an explicit identification
   workflow. Its results are never mixed into a project answer or page.
6. A `family:*` or `revision_hint:*` result is a lead to verify against source
   documents. It does not prove latest-version or supersession semantics.
7. Tags do not establish approval, validity, authorship, document authority or
   permission to act.
8. An unchanged move inside one project preserves the document identity and
   memory units while replacing the complete folder tag set. A move across
   `scope:project:*` boundaries is held as `RECLASSIFICATION_REQUIRED` until a
   valid cartouche reuses the displayed document identity and explicitly sets
   `scope_move_confirmed: true`.
9. Hermes-facing recall returns at most eight source-grounded `world` or
   `experience` facts. Each fact must expose an exact `document_id` and
   `chunk_id`. Consolidated observations without that provenance may support a
   separate exploratory workflow but cannot be returned as documentary proof.

If Hermes cannot resolve a unique project, it asks for the project or offers
candidate scopes. It must not fall back to a bank-wide document recall.

## Pages and mental models

Every project page or mental model uses the same strict scope selector as Hermes:

```text
scope:project:<project>
```

A page may additionally select a folder or phase, but it cannot remove the
project tag. Suggested projections are:

- overview;
- chronology;
- documents and possible versions;
- document relations and unresolved references;
- decisions, risks and actors.

Pages are derived summaries. Material claims remain traceable to the exact
Hindsight document, source path and, when available, PDF page.

## Information that is not a tag

Do not create unbounded tags for dates, extracted people, every document
reference or free-form facts. Use:

- metadata for source path, checksum, ingestion provenance and filename hints;
- entity schemas for normalized document types, actors and relation types;
- memories for extracted facts and dates;
- explicit document relations for `cites`, `responds_to`, `supersedes`,
  `supplements` or `attachment_of` when evidence exists.

This keeps the tag set small enough for reliable Hermes filtering.
