# Hermes Integration Models — Reconciliation

Status: active support doctrine — integration boundary reconciliation.
Boundary profile: candidate_support_note.

```text
OpenWebUI exposes.
Hermes Agent executes.
Pantheon Next governs.
The human decides consequential effects.
```

Two Hermes-integration models now exist in the candidates. They are **layers,
not competitors**. This note fixes how they compose so neither is mistaken for
the other and neither bypasses the chokepoint.

## The two models

### 1. Effect-centred chokepoint (per effect, synchronous)

The layer that decides whether one specific consequential effect may happen.

```text
consequential effect
  → PEP normalises it to request + gate_signals; derives a PEP-owned
    decision_expectation (required_ceiling / scope / object_identity / expected_digest)
  → PDP preflight (eligibility, missing gates, V0 effect flags)
  → PDP validate_decision (scope, ceiling, expiry, object identity, digest,
    human signer, and — when configured — human issuer authentication)
  → executor runs the effect only behind an allow verdict; fail-closed otherwise
```

Implemented: `mcp-server` (`evaluate_preflight`, `validate_decision`),
`pantheon-mvp` `policy_gate` (`enforce_consequential`, `governed_effect`),
hardened by the Paperless intake PEP. Governed by `HERMES_INTEGRATION.md`
(the chokepoint) and `UNIFORM_CAPABILITY_GOVERNANCE.md`.

### 2. Work-Issue-centred execution admission bridge (per run, asynchronous)

The layer that decides whether Hermes may **start a bounded run** for a Work
Issue, and observes what comes back.

```text
handoff preview → human Work Issue → human bounded Execution Admission
  (requested_effect, exact Work Issue version, explicit ttl, expires_at)
  → admission_id
  → [optional append-only human revocation before consumption]
  → external delivery — outside Pantheon
  → Hermes pulls the exact envelope, starts itself, posts a start callback
  → Hermes posts a normalised return callback (result_candidate / partial / failed / capability_gap)
```

Documented: `HERMES_EXECUTION_ADMISSION_BRIDGE.md` (candidate), implemented in
`pantheon-mvp` Cockpit V2. Explicitly no queue, scheduler, dispatcher or
Cockpit-invoked runtime start.

## How they compose

```text
Execution Admission  = bounded permission to START a run
                       (which Work Issue, which version, for how long, at what effect class)
Chokepoint           = per-effect policy gate DURING the run
                       (is this specific consequential effect allowed?)
```

An admitted run is permission to begin work; it is **not** permission for any
consequential effect the run may attempt. Every such effect still routes through
the chokepoint. A `read_only` admission means the run may not attempt a
consequential effect at all, and the chokepoint enforces that structurally
(`external_effect_allowed = false`, `canonical_effect_allowed = false` under V0).

```text
admission granted            != effect authorized
admitted run                 -> still blocked at the chokepoint for any consequential effect
read_only admission          -> consequential effects refused; not merely discouraged
runtime-start callback       != a command to start (observation only)
Hermes returned              != Work Issue resolved
runtime return               != Evidence admitted
```

## Two distinct human decisions

The models carry two different human decisions; do not collapse them.

```text
Execution Admission        = a human admits a bounded run for a Work Issue (run-scoped)
Validated decision reference = a human authorises one specific consequential effect (effect-scoped)
```

The issuer authenticated at the chokepoint (when a key registry is configured)
and the human who granted an admission may be the same person or not; each is
recorded on its own object. Neither is an approval by itself.

## Shared invariants

```text
Pantheon governs; it does not queue, schedule, dispatch or route providers.
Hermes pulls, self-starts and executes; it enforces the chokepoint verdict.
No consequential effect reaches the world without passing the chokepoint.
An admission bounds a run; the chokepoint bounds each effect.
Human issuer authentication proves who decided, never that the effect is permitted.
```

## Open, shared across both models

```text
authenticated human issuer  -> now available at the chokepoint when an issuer key
                               registry is configured; the admission side does not
                               yet bind an authenticated issuer to the admission act
live Hermes delivery binding -> not implemented in either model
runtime cancellation after consumption -> not implemented
```

## Final rule

```text
Admission answers "may a bounded run start?".
The chokepoint answers "may this effect happen?".
Both remain candidates; the human decides; Pantheon never becomes the runtime.
```
