# Terminology Boundaries

Status: active support doctrine — controlled vocabulary, reserved terms and migration guidance.

This document defines the preferred Pantheon Next vocabulary for future development and progressive cleanup of existing documents.

It does not rename schemas, tests, runtime objects, APIs, tool contracts, database fields, files, folders or external product concepts by itself.

It does not implement a runtime, workflow engine, scheduler, approval engine, memory engine, connector gateway, plugin manager, schema migration, automatic terminology linter, competence engine, skill generator or documentation-ingestion pipeline.

```text
OpenWebUI exposes.
Hermes Agent executes.
Pantheon Next governs.
```

## Purpose

Pantheon Next must avoid terms that make governance look like execution, runtime state, automatic validation or generic memory.

A term is acceptable only if its layer is clear:

```text
Pantheon governs status, scope, evidence, approval, memory and external-action legitimacy.
The execution runtime executes workflows, skills, tools, jobs and actions.
The exposure surface exposes, captures and displays.
The professional decides.
```

This document is a vocabulary boundary. It is not a dictionary of every word in the repository.

## Canonical grammar

Use short object names plus explicit status rather than long compound nouns.

Preferred shape:

```text
Object · status
```

Examples:

```text
Assertion · proposed
Assertion · sourced
Evidence · candidate
Evidence · contradicted
Register · validated
Recall · stale
Capability · suspended
Competence · candidate
```

Avoid silently changing the noun to imply authority.

```text
candidate output ≠ deliverable
retrieved source ≠ evidence
runtime memory ≠ Register
workflow run ≠ approval
trace ≠ proof
competence available ≠ action authorized
skill executed ≠ Pantheon validated
```

## Reserved runtime vocabulary

The following words belong to execution and infrastructure unless explicitly qualified as candidates or references.

| Term | French | Reserved for | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Runtime | Hermes, LangGraph or another execution environment | Executes outside Pantheon. |
| Workflow | Workflow | executable process, runtime graph, CI flow, automation | Pantheon may govern a Workflow Candidate, but does not run workflows. |
| Skill | Skill | Hermes or runtime-executable ability | Pantheon governs Capability and Competence status; Hermes executes Skill. |
| Tool | Outil | runtime or host callable tool | Availability is not authorization. |
| Plugin | Plugin | host-system extension | Plugin presence is not governed permission. |
| Job | Job | technical execution unit | Not a governance task. |
| Action | Action | operational effect | External action needs approval if consequential. |
| State | État | runtime state | Not memory, not Register. |
| Run | Run | runtime execution instance | Run success is not approval. |
| Node | Nœud | graph/runtime function | Not a Role. |
| Edge | Arête | graph transition | Not a governance path. |
| Checkpoint | Checkpoint | runtime snapshot | Not Evidence. |
| Thread | Thread | runtime or conversation continuity | Not Case. |
| Queue | File | infrastructure queue | Not Pantheon scheduling. |
| Scheduler | Planificateur | infrastructure timing | Not Pantheon governance. |
| Worker | Worker | executor process | Not a Pantheon Role. |

## Capability, competence, skill, plugin and capacity

These words must not collapse.

```text
Capability is the abstract governable effect class.
Competence is a bounded reusable ability governed by Pantheon.
Skill is the execution-side projection, typically Hermes.
Plugin is a host-system extension.
Capacity means volume, load or limit.
```

French:

```text
La Capacité est la classe abstraite d'effet gouvernable.
La Compétence est une capacité réutilisable, bornée et gouvernée par Pantheon.
Le Skill est la projection exécutable, typiquement côté Hermes.
Le Plugin est une extension d'un hôte.
Capacity signifie jauge, volume, charge ou limite.
```

Rules:

```text
Use Capability for the abstract kernel-level placement test.
Use Competence for governed reusable abilities such as filling a PDF, querying an API, calculating a surface, producing a diagram or doing sourced web research.
Use Skill only for execution-side ability.
Use Plugin only for host-system extension.
Use Capacity only when the meaning is quantity or load.
Professional judgement remains with the professional; a system Competence is not professional authority.
```

See `COMPETENCE_MODEL.md` for the governed competence vocabulary.

## Connaissance, guide, resource and template

These words also must not collapse.

```text
Connaissance = what the profession, project, contract or rule says.
Guide de compétence = method document explaining how to do something.
Ressource de compétence = material used by a competence.
Template = reusable form of an output.
```

Examples:

| Situation | Connaissance | Guide / Resource | Competence | Template |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fill a PDF | values to enter: client, address, parcel, surfaces | PDF/OCR/AcroForm docs | PDF filling | field mapping |
| Surface taxable | tax and project rules, plans, measured areas | calculation guide, official notes, examples | calculate taxable surface | calculation table |
| API query | address, parcel, SIRET or professional input | API docs, examples, wiki | query an API | API result sheet |
| d3.js diagram | project/cards/status data | d3.js docs, snippets | produce a diagram | graph template |

A documentation API, d3.js guide, OCR manual, PDF library guide or wiki about how to operate a tool is a Guide or Ressource de compétence.

It is not a Connaissance métier unless it directly states professional, regulatory, contractual or project content.

A Template structures output. It never validates content.

## Case, folder, corpus and dossier

`Dossier` is useful in public French prose, but dangerous as a canonical system word because it can mean professional matter, file folder or document bundle.

Preferred distinctions:

| Term | French | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Case | Affaire | professional unit followed by Pantheon |
| Project | Projet | architecture/construction subtype of Case |
| Situation | Situation | concrete question or tension inside a Case |
| Corpus | Corpus | mobilized document set |
| Folder | Dossier | file-storage directory only |

Use `Affaire` for the governed professional unit. Reserve `Dossier` for public language or storage/folder contexts unless the surrounding text makes the meaning explicit.

## Method, approach and workflow

These three words mark three different layers.

| Term | French | Layer | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Method | Méthode | professional domain | architecture method, legal method, medical method |
| Approach | Démarche | reusable governed handling of a Situation | PLU response approach, CCTP review approach |
| Workflow | Workflow | executable runtime process | Hermes workflow, LangGraph graph, CI workflow |

Rules:

```text
Method frames the profession.
Approach handles a recurring Situation.
Workflow executes in the runtime.
```

French:

```text
La Méthode cadre le métier.
La Démarche traite une Situation récurrente.
Le Workflow s'exécute dans le runtime.
```

Avoid `meta-workflow` as a canonical term. Use `Approach` or `governance lifecycle` depending on whether the subject is reusable professional handling or status progression.

## Assertion, expression, manifestation and finding

Use `Assertion` for truth-status work.

| Term | French | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assertion | Assertion | statement to qualify | central truth-status object |
| Expression | Expression | wording or formulation | IRIS may modify without changing substance |
| Manifestation | Manifestation | observed trigger or sign | may create a Situation |
| Finding | Constat | validated Assertion | use only after review/approval |
| Conclusion | Conclusion | final reasoning output | avoid before validation |

Example:

```text
Manifestation: the city asks for a permeable-ground justification.
Situation: possible planning-compliance risk.
Approach: regulated response review.
Assertion: delivery areas may be excluded from the relevant surface calculation.
Evidence: PLU excerpt, massing plan and surface table.
Gate: architect approval before city reply.
Approval: professional validates the response.
Register: decision preserved for the Case.
```

## Assertion lifecycle

Assertions may evolve, but not silently.

```text
Draft assertions may be edited.
Sourced assertions must be revised.
Validated assertions must be superseded, not overwritten.
Registered assertions must be linked, not erased.
```

French:

```text
Les assertions brouillon peuvent être modifiées.
Les assertions sourcées doivent être révisées.
Les assertions validées doivent être remplacées, pas écrasées.
Les assertions inscrites au Registre doivent être liées, jamais effacées silencieusement.
```

Recommended statuses:

```text
proposed
unsupported
sourced
contradicted
to_verify
validated
rejected
superseded
archived
```

## Memory, recall, register, archive and trace

Avoid unqualified `Memory` in governance text.

| Term | French | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Recall | Rappel | candidate material returned by runtime memory, search, graph recall or adapter |
| Record | Enregistrement | stored data without validation by itself |
| Register | Registre | validated, scoped and durable memory |
| Archive | Archive | preserved but inactive past |
| Trace | Trace | reviewable history, not proof by itself |

Rules:

```text
Runtime memory is Recall.
Stored data is Record.
Validated memory is Register.
Inactive past is Archive.
Execution history is Trace.
```

French:

```text
La mémoire runtime est du Rappel.
La donnée stockée est un Enregistrement.
La mémoire validée est le Registre.
Le passé inactif est l'Archive.
L'historique d'exécution est une Trace.
```

## Role vocabulary

A Pantheon Role is not an agent.

| Term | French | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Role | Rôle | governance authority viewpoint |
| Charter | Charte | canonical definition of a Role |
| Mandate | Mandat | what the Role must examine |
| Lens | Regard | useful review angle |
| Power | Pouvoir | authorized governance effect |
| Limit | Limite | what the Role must not do |
| Signal | Signal | structured inter-role message |
| Activation | Activation | when the Role is active, mandatory, suspended or blocked |
| Attribute | Attribut | descriptive metadata only |

Rules:

```text
A Role has a Charter, Mandate, Lens, Powers, Limits, Signals, Activation and Attributes.
An Attribute describes.
A Mandate obliges.
A Limit blocks.
A Power authorizes.
A Signal transmits.
Activation conditions.
```

French:

```text
Un Rôle a une Charte, un Mandat, un Regard, des Pouvoirs, des Limites, des Signaux, une Activation et des Attributs.
Un Attribut décrit.
Un Mandat oblige.
Une Limite bloque.
Un Pouvoir autorise.
Un Signal transmet.
Une Activation conditionne.
```

Do not use `Role Profile` as a canonical term. Use `Hermes profile aligned with a Pantheon Role` when referring to execution-side profiles.

## Existing vocabulary migration rules

Existing documents may continue using historical terms until they are revised. New work should follow this mapping.

| Existing / risky term | Preferred term | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Matter | Case | Use Case as English canonical term. |
| Dossier as system unit | Case / Affaire | Reserve dossier for public prose or Folder. |
| Path | Approach | Use when the sequence is reusable across Cases. |
| Meta-workflow | Approach / governance lifecycle | Do not use as canonical term. |
| Workflow in Pantheon doctrine | Approach unless executable | Keep Workflow only for Workflow Candidate or runtime. |
| Claim | Assertion | Claim becomes a deprecated English alias. |
| Affirmation | Assertion | French public alias only if needed. |
| Expression as truth object | Assertion | Expression is wording only. |
| Finding as candidate | Assertion / candidate | Finding is validated only. |
| Memory | Recall or Register | Always distinguish candidate recall from validated register. |
| Skill in Pantheon | Competence or Capability | Skill is execution-side. |
| Plugin | Capability / host plugin | Plugin remains host-system language. |
| Competence as runtime skill | Competence / Skill | Competence is governed reusable ability; Skill is runtime projection. |
| Knowledge as generic file pile | Connaissance / Source / Guide / Ressource | Distinguish métier knowledge from competence documentation and retrieval material. |
| Agent | Role | Agent reserved for runtime/external products. |
| Multi-agent | College | No hidden agent debate. |
| Orchestrator | Arbiter / coordinator | Avoid runtime implication. |
