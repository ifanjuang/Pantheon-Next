# Example — Architecture / Urbanisme — Governed Handoff for ABF / mairie reply

Status: fictional professional example — educational support only.

This example shows how Pantheon frames a sensitive architecture / urbanisme task before an execution runtime prepares a draft.

It is not legal advice, planning advice, administrative advice or architectural validation. It does not replace the architect's judgment, site knowledge, client instruction, planning authority position, ABF consultation or professional liability review.

## Scenario

A mairie sends a request for complementary material on a facade change in a protected or heritage-sensitive context.

The practitioner asks:

```text
Prepare a reply to the mairie and ABF about the requested facade documents.
```

A raw assistant may produce a fluent answer that sounds ready to send. That is unsafe because the task may touch:

- regulatory interpretation;
- scope of the submitted works;
- completeness of administrative exhibits;
- ABF-facing wording;
- client and project responsibility;
- external transmission.

Pantheon must separate drafting from sending, evidence from proof and runtime success from governance approval.

## Intake classification

```text
request_type: professional external communication preparation
professional_domain: architecture_urbanisme
consequence: high
external_effect_possible: yes
status: Task Contract required
```

The task is not a simple writing request. It is a candidate external communication under professional responsibility.

## Source intake — admitted, excluded, missing

```yaml
source_intake:
  admitted:
    - mairie_request_2026-06-11.pdf
    - notice_architecturale_candidate.md
    - facade_photos_contact_sheet.pdf
    - planning_extract_candidate.pdf
  excluded:
    - unrelated client emails
    - prior project notes not cited in the mairie request
    - unstamped screenshots from another dossier
  missing_or_unconfirmed:
    - confirmed recipient service
    - exact filing channel
    - current list of demanded exhibits
    - dated protected-context source
    - explicit ABF position, if any
  intake_status: admitted_with_gaps
```

Nothing in this intake proves that the reply may be sent. It only says what the execution runtime may use to prepare a candidate.

task_contract:
  id: TC-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
  intent: "Prepare a draft reply to the mairie / ABF request for complementary facade material."

    minimum_gate: User Decision Gate
  register_rules:
    default: no Register Candidate unless a scoped, sourced and approved project fact is extracted
```

## Context Pack excerpt

```yaml
context_pack:
  id: CP-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
  purpose: "Give the execution runtime only the material needed to prepare a draft reply."
  scope:
    type: dossier
    label: "Fictional facade change dossier"
  included_sources:
    - mairie_request_2026-06-11.pdf
    - notice_architecturale_candidate.md
    - facade_photos_contact_sheet.pdf
    - planning_extract_candidate.pdf
  excluded_sources:
    - unrelated client emails
    - prior project notes not cited in the mairie request
  assumptions:
    - "The protected-context status is treated as user-provided until verified in a source."
    - "The exact ABF position is not assumed unless present in the request."
  open_questions:
    - "Which exhibits are actually missing?"
    - "Is the recipient service confirmed?"
    - "Should the reply be only a draft or also a filing instruction?"
  evidence_expectations:
    - cite every regulatory or procedural claim
    - list missing exhibits instead of pretending completeness
    - keep ABF position distinct from mairie instruction
```

## Decision Gate

```yaml
decision_gate:
  id: DG-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
  conflict: "The user wants a reply, but sending or filing would create an external administrative effect."
  options:
    - prepare_draft_only
    - prepare_internal_issue_note_only
    - ask_for_missing_sources
    - send_directly
  selected_option: prepare_draft_only
  rejected_options:
    send_directly: "External effect requires explicit professional approval."
  status: approved_for_draft_only
```

## Handoff preflight

The bridge or exposure surface should classify the request before any runtime call.

```yaml
handoff_preflight:
  requested_action: draft_external_reply_candidate
  detected_effect: internal_state_change
  external_effect_requested_now: false
  canonical_effect_requested_now: false
  approval_available_for_send: false
  source_gaps:
    - recipient_unconfirmed
    - filing_channel_unconfirmed
    - protected_context_source_unconfirmed
  outcome: allow_candidate_only
```

If the user had asked "send it now", the outcome would change:

```yaml
handoff_preflight:
  requested_action: send_external_reply
  detected_effect: external_effect
  approval_available_for_send: false
  outcome: needs_approval
  safe_fallback: prepare_draft_only
```

If the user had asked the assistant to record the ABF position as a project fact, the outcome would be blocked:

```yaml
handoff_preflight:
  requested_action: record_project_fact
  detected_effect: canonical_effect
  source_gaps:
    - explicit_ABF_position_absent
  outcome: block
  reason: "The runtime cannot create or update a Registre Probatoire entry."
```

## Governed execution handoff

This is the bounded object passed to the execution runtime. It is not an execution graph and does not make Pantheon run the work.

```yaml
governed_execution_handoff:
  handoff_id: EH-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
  linked_task_contract: TC-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001

    - CP-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
    - DG-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
```

## Invalid handoffs

These handoffs must be refused before runtime dispatch.

```yaml
invalid_handoff_external_effect_without_approval:
  requested_effect: external_effect
  action_family: send_external_reply
  approval_ref: null
  result: refused
  reason: "External effect without explicit approval."
```

```yaml
invalid_handoff_missing_idempotency:
  requested_effect: external_effect
  action_family: file_administrative_document
  approval_ref: APPROVAL-EXAMPLE-001
  idempotency_key: null
  result: refused
  reason: "Non-read-only effects require an idempotency key."
```

```yaml
invalid_handoff_canonical_effect:
  requested_effect: canonical_effect
  action_family: update_Registre_Probatoire_entry
  result: refused
  reason: "Canonical effects use the governed validation path, not runtime execution."
```

## Capability Gap examples

A gap is returned when the work cannot be safely prepared.

```yaml
capability_gap:
  gap_id: GAP-ARCH-ABF-001
  missing: recipient_unconfirmed
  needed_for: external_reply_preparation
  blocked_effect: external_effect
  consequence_if_ignored: "The draft may be addressed to the wrong service or imply the wrong filing path."
  safe_fallback: "Prepare internal issue note and unresolved questions only."
  required_human_or_admin_action: "Confirm recipient and filing channel."
  status: degraded
  trace_refs:
    - TC-ARCH-ABF-REPLY-001
```

```yaml
capability_gap:
  gap_id: GAP-ARCH-ABF-002
  missing: explicit_ABF_position_source
  needed_for: claim_about_ABF_position
  blocked_effect: professional_truth_claim
  consequence_if_ignored: "The reply may infer an ABF position that has not been evidenced."
  safe_fallback: "Use neutral wording: services consultés / position finale non préjugée."
  required_human_or_admin_action: "Provide or verify the dated ABF exchange."
  status: blocked
```

      - verify_exhibit_list
      - approve_before_send
```

## Candidate internal issue note

```text
The reply may be prepared as a draft only.

The dossier should not state that the facade proposal is accepted or that ABF agreement is acquired unless a dated source says so. The draft should identify the requested exhibits, distinguish already supplied material from missing material and preserve any uncertainty around the protected-context status.

Before sending, the architect must verify the recipient, the exhibit list, the current planning source and the exact administrative effect of the reply.
```

## Candidate draft email

```text
Subject: Complementary material — facade change dossier [PROJECT REF]

Bonjour,

Nous faisons suite à votre demande de pièces complémentaires relative au dossier de modification de façade.

À ce stade, nous préparons les éléments suivants pour répondre à votre demande :

1. les vues de façade mises à jour ;
2. les photographies de l'existant ;
3. la notice précisant les matériaux et teintes envisagés ;
4. les éléments nécessaires à la bonne lecture du projet dans son contexte.

Avant transmission définitive, nous vérifions la concordance entre la liste des pièces demandées et les documents déjà produits afin d'éviter tout écart de périmètre.

Cette réponse ne préjuge pas de l'instruction du dossier ni de la position finale des services consultés.

Cordialement,
[ARCHITECT]
```

## What Pantheon prevents

This example matters because the dangerous failure is not only hallucination. The dangerous failure is a clean professional message treated as safe to transmit when its sources, scope and approval are still incomplete.

Pantheon prevents:

- draft treated as sent;
- runtime success treated as professional validation;
- source gap hidden by fluent wording;
- ABF / mairie position inferred without source;
- administrative filing without explicit approval;
- duplicate send or filing on retry;
- project fact promoted into the Registre Probatoire without review.

## Final reading

```text
The execution runtime may draft the reply.
Pantheon governs whether the reply is bounded, sourced, reviewable and blocked before external effect.
The professional decides whether anything leaves the office.
```
