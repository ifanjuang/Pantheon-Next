# Example — Medical Referral Letter from Consultation Notes

Status: fictional professional example — educational support only.

This example illustrates how Pantheon Next may frame AI-assisted preparation of a medical correspondence draft.

It is not medical advice.

It is not a diagnostic tool.

It is not a prescription tool.

It does not replace the physician’s clinical judgment, legal obligations, data-security duties or professional responsibility.

## Scenario

A general practitioner needs to prepare a referral letter to a cardiologist from:

- consultation notes;
- recent lab results;
- ECG information;
- current treatment;
- relevant medical history.

The target is not autonomous diagnosis.

The target is a structured candidate letter that the physician reviews, corrects, signs and files.

## User request

```text
Prepare a referral letter to the cardiologist from my consultation notes and the latest lab results.
```

## Mission sheet — Task Contract excerpt

```text
Mission        : Referral letter — cardiology
Scope          : Patient [PSEUDO-A7], consultation [DATE-MASKED]
Allowed        : pseudonymized consultation note
                 relevant lab values
                 ECG summary
                 relevant history and treatment
Forbidden      : unrelated patient records
                 unrelated history
                 autonomous diagnosis
                 treatment recommendation beyond supplied notes
Output         : 1-page candidate referral letter
Approval       : physician review and signature required before use
Memory         : file in patient record only; no durable AI memory
```

## Data handling note

This example uses pseudonymization and minimization as teaching concepts.

Pseudonymization is not anonymization.

A patient may remain identifiable by context, dates, rare conditions or combined details.

Pantheon should therefore support several statuses:

```text
clear data
minimized data
pseudonymized data
still re-identifiable data
external sending forbidden
local processing only
```

## Evidence Pack excerpt

```text
Sources used:
- consultation note [pseudonymized]
- lab values [DATE-MASKED]
- ECG summary [DATE-MASKED]

Clinical elements preserved:
- blood pressure
- heart rate
- relevant current treatment
- symptom description supplied by physician

Missing / limits:
- no autonomous interpretation of ECG beyond supplied summary
- no diagnosis added by the model
- no treatment decision proposed by the model

Risk notes:
- candidate correspondence only
- physician must review, amend and sign
- identifying fields reinjected locally only if appropriate
```

## Candidate deliverable excerpt

```text
Dear colleague,

I am referring my patient [PSEUDO-A7], 58 years old, treated for hypertension, for cardiology review.

Reason for referral:
Intermittent palpitations reported over the last three weeks, without syncope or chest pain according to the consultation note.

Elements supplied:
- BP: 142/88 mmHg
- HR: 92/min, irregular on auscultation
- ECG summary: ventricular extrasystoles, tracing attached
- Lab values: potassium 3.9 mmol/L, TSH within normal range

Question for review:
Could you advise on diagnostic confirmation and whether Holter monitoring is indicated?

Kind regards,
Dr [NAME-MASKED]
```

## User Decision Gate

A User Decision Gate is needed if the user asks the system to:

- add a diagnosis not present in the notes;
- recommend treatment;
- send the letter automatically;
- retain identifiable health information outside the patient record.

```text
Decision required:
Keep the output as a correspondence draft
or
add professional clinical content manually
or
block external processing / sending
```

## Memory rule

No durable AI memory should be created from identifiable or re-identifiable health information.

Possible Memory Candidate only at method level:

```text
For medical correspondence drafts, require source-bounded input, pseudonymization/minimization check, physician review and no autonomous diagnosis.
```

This is method memory, not patient memory.

## Why this example matters

The useful distinction is:

```text
correspondence drafting ≠ diagnosis
pseudonymization ≠ anonymization
candidate letter ≠ signed medical document
stored patient file ≠ AI memory
```
