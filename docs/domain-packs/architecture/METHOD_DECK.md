# Architecture Method Deck

Status: candidate support doctrine — architecture-domain Method Cards for governed AI use in agency workflows.

Runtime status: non-executable.

This document specializes `METHOD_CARD_MODEL.md` for architecture practice.

It does not implement a UI, renderer, workflow engine, method selector, source validator, RAG system, OCR pipeline, PDF tool, email sender, approval engine, memory engine, Hermes skill, connector, schema, test or external action.

```text
Optional runtime clients may expose interaction.
Hermes Agent executes.
Pantheon Next governs.
```

## Purpose

Architecture work is consequential because an AI error can become a wrong source, an implicit validation, a mission-scope expansion, a false proof, an unauthorized transmission or a professional commitment.

This deck turns generic Method Cards into professional cards that can be proposed by Roles during Runs.

```text
A method appears because a Role detects a tension.
It does not appear because it is intellectually interesting.
```

## Cockpit budget

A task should normally expose at most:

```text
1 primary method;
1 guardrail method;
1 verification method;
other methods stay in the trace unless they change proof, scope, cost, status, memory or action.
```

## Practical deck posture

This deck is intentionally broader than what the cockpit should show by default.

```text
Deck breadth is allowed.
Cockpit clutter is not.
```

The deck is a reference set for architecture-domain method selection. It should not be rendered as a flat checklist where every card competes for visibility.

### Visibility tiers

| Tier | Method posture | Cards | Cockpit rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | gateway methods | `source_admission`, `assertion_mapping`, `mission_scope_guard`, `external_commitment_guard`, `probative_review` | eligible for default task visibility when the corresponding risk is present |
| B | dossier-specialist methods | `authority_qualification`, `contractual_decomposition`, `phase_gate_review`, `site_observation_review`, `quote_variation_review`, `visa_commitment_review`, `reception_risk_review`, `cerfa_field_claim_review` | visible only when the dossier situation matches or a gateway method spawns them |
| C | productive method | `constrained_generation` | visible only when drafting, synthesis or variant generation is itself the requested work or creates risk |

Tier A cards form the practical skeleton of the architecture deck. They answer the recurring governance questions:

```text
What entered?
What does the output claim?
Does it exceed mission or responsibility?
Does it leave the perimeter?
Is the support sufficient for the intended effect?
```

Tier B cards specialize the skeleton for real architecture situations. They should not be preloaded unless the task mentions, receives or produces the relevant object: quote, contract, phase, site observation, visa, reception or CERFA.

Tier C is intentionally separated. `constrained_generation` can produce useful drafts, image prompts, variants or synthesis candidates. It is not a proof, source review, mission guard or external-action gate.

### Selection rule

```text
Start with the smallest useful method set.
Add a specialist method only when a trigger is explicit.
Keep unused methods in the trace, not on the screen.
```

A normal task should start from one of these patterns:

| Situation | Primary method | Guardrail method | Verification method |
|---|---|---|---|
| source enters the task | `source_admission` | `mission_scope_guard` if wording may engage the agency | `probative_review` if a claim will rely on it |
| output contains factual claims | `assertion_mapping` | `mission_scope_guard` if claims imply responsibility | `probative_review` |
| external send / filing / publication | `external_commitment_guard` | `mission_scope_guard` | `probative_review` |
| complementary quote | `quote_variation_review` | `contractual_decomposition` | `probative_review` |
| chantier report | `site_observation_review` | `mission_scope_guard` | `assertion_mapping` |
| CERFA / administrative filing | `cerfa_field_claim_review` | `external_commitment_guard` | `probative_review` |
| EXE / VISA | `visa_commitment_review` | `mission_scope_guard` | `probative_review` |
| reception / reserve lifting | `reception_risk_review` | `mission_scope_guard` | `probative_review` |
| draft / synthesis / image prompt | `constrained_generation` | `mission_scope_guard` if professional posture appears | `assertion_mapping` if factual claims are introduced |

If a second specialist method is needed, the card must record why the first one was insufficient. This prevents method inflation from becoming a disguised workflow engine.

## Role registry discipline

`likely_roles` must only name registered Pantheon Roles from `AGENTS.md`.

A professional human reviewer, architect, maître d'oeuvre, project lead or client representative is not a Pantheon Role.

When human professional judgement is required, use `human_review`, not `likely_roles`.

No new role is promoted by this deck.

## Common fields

Each professional card should define:

## Review conclusion — 2026-06-29

Accepted:

```text
The deck may remain broad as a reference deck for architecture-domain Method Cards.
Tier A gateway methods should carry most cockpit visibility.
Tier B specialist methods should appear only on explicit dossier triggers.
Tier C productive generation must stay separate from proof and gate methods.
```

Refused:

```text
Flat display of every Method Card in ordinary tasks.
Treating a method sequence as a workflow engine.
Treating a productive generation method as proof, validation or approval.
```

To verify:

```text
Use PR #238 run tests to check whether the Tier A / B / C split reduces cockpit noise.
Review the mobile prototype with real architecture prompts and long French labels.
Check whether some Tier B methods should move into example-only material if they rarely trigger.
```

To arbitrate:

```text
Whether this deck stays candidate support doctrine or is split later into:
1. a compact active architecture cockpit deck;
2. an extended reference deck;
3. run-test examples.
```

## Relationship with reasoning modes

Raw reasoning modes remain governed by `REASONING_MODES_LIBRARY.md`.

This deck translates some of them into professional method cards suitable for cockpit visibility.

## Core invariant

```text
Architecture Method Cards guide professional AI work.
They produce candidates, questions and gates.
They do not validate, approve, send, remember or execute.
```

The validated remains.
