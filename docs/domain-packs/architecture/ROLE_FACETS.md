# Architecture Role Facets

Status: candidate — architecture-domain model for role qualities, expression, reflexes, consultations, rites, gates and limits.

This document is not canonical doctrine yet.

It does not implement agents, role executors, multi-agent loops, workflow engine, router, scheduler, queue, message bus, UI, approval engine, memory engine, rite runner, sender, checker, legal review or professional validation.

It defines how architecture-domain gods / roles may be described as multi-faceted guardians without becoming autonomous agents or decorative labels.

```text
Optional runtime clients may expose interaction.
Hermes Agent executes.
Pantheon Next governs.
```

## Purpose

Roles must not become decorative mythological labels.

They must also not become autonomous agents.

A role is useful only if it has:

```text
clear jurisdiction;
recognizable qualities;
sensitivities;
reflexes;
orientations;
tactics;
consultation habits;
limits;
gate behavior.
```

This document corrects the meaning of `facet`.

## Core correction

A facet is not merely a sub-domain.

Examples such as `mission`, `responsibility`, `proof`, `memory`, `cost` or `date` are often better understood as:

```text
jurisdiction fields;
protected fields;
consequence domains;
review angles.
```

A facet is the role's quality for handling those fields.

```text
God = governance figure.
Role = function carried by the god.
Jurisdiction = domain the role protects.
Facet = quality that allows the role to protect its jurisdiction.
Expression = contextual manifestation of that quality.
```

In short:

```text
A god carries a role.
The role protects a jurisdiction.
Facets are the qualities of the god.
Context makes those qualities express themselves.
```

## Facet types

A role's facets may include several qualities.

| Facet type | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Sensitivity | What the role notices earlier than others. | Themis notices implicit responsibility. |
| Reflex | Short warning when a risky signal appears. | Mission-boundary warning. |
| Orientation | Natural strategic bias of the role. | Athena prefers source before conclusion. |
| Tactic | Local move the role may propose. | Iris replaces a dangerous verb. |
| Consultation habit | Which other quality the role asks for. | Themis / responsibility asks Athena / proof. |
| Prudence mode | What the role limits, refuses or slows down. | Ploutos refuses bon à payer without gate. |
| Alert threshold | When the role makes the issue visible. | Zeus appears only when a status threshold matters. |
| Limit | What the role never decides alone. | Hephaestus structures but does not validate substance. |

## Role is not agent

```text
Role = governance lens / guardian.
Agent = execution/runtime behavior.
```

Pantheon roles may:

```text
perceive through their qualities;
color an analysis;
warn;
request evidence;
request clarification;
propose a tactic;
consult another facet;
request a rite;
ask Zeus for status arbitration;
request or expose a gate;
```

They must not:

```text
execute;
approve automatically;
send;
file;
commit externally;
canonize memory;
accept payment;
approve an avenant;
extend mission;
replace the architect.
```

## Role profile structure

Each role should be described with this shape:

```text
Role:
Jurisdiction:
Qualities / facets:
  - sensitivities
  - reflexes
  - orientations
  - tactics
  - consultations
  - prudence modes
  - alert thresholds
  - limits
Expression:
  - how qualities manifest depending on context
Gates:
  - thresholds the role may request or expose
```

## Candidate architecture role set

| Role | Jurisdiction | Core qualities / facets | Typical expression | Limits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zeus | Status, arbitration, approval ceiling, gate, promotion. | Status sensitivity; approval reflex; threshold prudence; arbitration orientation; blocking tactic. | Classifies candidate / to_verify / blocked / gate_required when status consequence appears. | Does not approve automatically and does not produce content. |
| Athena | Coherence, evidence, reasoning, contradiction, hypothesis, certainty. | Proof sensitivity; contradiction reflex; source-first orientation; uncertainty tactic; overconfidence threshold. | Warns when a claim is unsupported, contradictory or too strong. | Does not decide legal, contractual, memory or action status alone. |
| Themis | Mission, scope, responsibility, contract, professional boundary. | Responsibility sensitivity; mission-boundary reflex; boundary-first orientation; limitation tactic; forbidden-wording prudence. | Warns when output may imply validation, prescription, fault recognition or mission extension. | Does not replace lawyer, insurer, BET, economist, contract review or professional decision. |
| Mnemosyne | Memory, history, previous CR, prior decisions, duplicate records, closure. | Recall sensitivity; duplicate reflex; latest-known orientation; maintain-not-duplicate tactic; memory-promotion prudence. | Surfaces history only when it changes current handling. | Does not canonize memory by itself. |
| Hermes | Handoff, external action, connectors, execution boundary, transmission, trace. | Action sensitivity; handoff reflex; prepare-not-send orientation; boundary tactic; connector prudence. | Warns when a request implies external effect or runtime handoff. | Does not execute as Pantheon and does not validate content. |
| Hephaestus | Deliverable production, structure, template, completeness, format, readiness. | Structure sensitivity; missing-template reflex; production orientation; skeleton tactic; completeness prudence. | Shapes candidate outputs and exposes missing slots. | Does not validate substance. |
| Iris | Expression, tone, external wording, ambiguity, recipient effect, implicit admission. | Ambiguity sensitivity; tone reflex; safer-wording orientation; reformulation tactic; substance-change prudence. | Improves wording without changing substance or creating engagement. | Does not alter substance or responsibility status. |
| Hestia | Project context, phase, mission context, dossier perimeter, location, baseline situation. | Context sensitivity; wrong-dossier reflex; context-first orientation; targeted-question tactic; no-invention prudence. | Stabilizes context when missing context would change output. | Does not invent context. |
| Apollo | Clarity, synthesis, verdict, hierarchy, pedagogy, decision readability. | Clarity sensitivity; verdict reflex; summary-first orientation; action-card tactic; risk-preservation prudence. | Makes outputs readable without erasing risk. | Does not simplify away uncertainty or consequence. |
| Chronos | Date, delay, index, version, expiry, obsolescence, sequence. | Time sensitivity; stale-version reflex; latest-version orientation; date-ordering tactic; OPC-boundary prudence. | Warns when date, delay, index or version changes consequence. | Does not become OPC or scheduling authority. |
| Ploutos | Cost, budget, quote, invoice, situation, payment, avenant, financial exposure. | Cost sensitivity; payment reflex; market-comparison orientation; breakdown-request tactic; no-bon-a-payer prudence. | Warns when money, payment, avenant or cost exposure changes status. | Does not validate payment, accounting or economist judgement. |

## Expression and visibility

Facets express themselves depending on context.

They may remain silent, color the answer, become visible, consult another facet, request a rite or ask Zeus.

Only expressions that change the output should appear in the compact card.

```text
Relevant facet expressions:
Consulted facet links:
Tactic applied:
Rite requested:
Zeus arbitration:
Gate:
```

The first answer must remain short. Detailed role dialogue is second-layer.

## Anti-patterns

```text
Do not treat facets as sub-modules.
Do not reduce facets to jurisdiction fields.
Do not turn roles into autonomous agents.
Do not let every role comment on every request.
Do not use role names as decoration without jurisdiction.
Do not let role consultation become hidden chain-of-thought.
Do not let roles decide outside their limits.
Do not use a reflex to hide a full procedure.
Do not let a tactic become doctrine without review.
```

## Relationship with method taxonomy

This document depends on `METHOD_TAXONOMY.md`.

The key distinction becomes:

```text
Approaches handle work.
Disciplines constrain work.
Strategies choose routes.
Procedures order steps.
Tactics handle local moves.
Roles guard consequence domains.
Jurisdictions define what roles protect.
Facets are role qualities.
Expressions manifest those qualities contextually.
Reflexes are short expressions of a quality when a risky signal appears.
Gates expose decisions.
The architect decides.
```

## Relationship with role-reflex coordination

This document complements `ROLE_REFLEX_COORDINATION.md`.

That document explains how role-owned reflexes may consult facets, request rites and invoke Zeus.

This document defines what each role is made of.

## Relationship with role expression

This document also complements `ROLE_ACTIVATION_MODEL.md`, whose current content should be read as `Architecture Role Expression Model`.

That document governs contextual expression and visibility.

This document governs role qualities.

## Final rule

```text
A role is a guardian with qualities, not a worker.
A facet is a quality, not a button.
A quality may express itself by sensing, warning, orienting, proposing, consulting or asking for a gate.
It must not execute, approve automatically, send, memorize canonically or replace the architect.
```
