"""Every reviewed pin a deployment script demands must exist in `release.env`.

The Ubuntu node scripts read their pins as `${RELEASE_X:?release.env missing
RELEASE_X}`. Under `set -Eeuo pipefail` an undefined name is not a warning: the
script dies on its first line, before any action. Ten such names are consumed
and never defined, so four scripts cannot run at all:

    install-node, update-node        RELEASE_TORCHVISION_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_TORCHAUDIO_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_LIVESYNC_BUILD_NPM_VERSION
    configure-docling-local          RELEASE_DOCLING_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_DOCLING_MCP_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_DOCLING_PYTHON
    configure-marker-local           RELEASE_MARKER_PDF_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_MARKER_PYTHON
                                     RELEASE_OBSIDIAN_MARKER_VERSION
                                     RELEASE_NVIDIA_CONTAINER_TOOLKIT_VERSION

Nothing checked the two halves against each other, so the gap was invisible
until a script was actually run on a machine.

`release.env` carries *reviewed* deployment targets. A value invented to make
this test pass would assert a review that never happened -- and a wrong CUDA
pin breaks a real node. So the ten names below are recorded as debt rather than
filled in: the ratchet is the floor, and it only shrinks. Adding a reviewed
value to `release.env` and deleting its line here is the whole retirement path.
A *new* undefined name fails immediately, with no seeded debt to hide in.
