"""The `Boundary profile:` line had an owner, a vocabulary and no enforcement.

`docs/governance/BOUNDARY_PROFILES.md` (active support doctrine) defines the
profiles. `docs/governance/STATUS_HEADER_RULES.md` (active support doctrine)
tells authors to write the line. Neither is checked anywhere, so seventeen
profile names that BOUNDARY_PROFILES.md does not define entered circulation —
including two near-misses of defined names (`validation_only` for
`validation_only_trace`, `candidate_support_doctrine` for
`candidate_support_note`) and six free-form phrases.

That matters now rather than in the abstract: #996 migrates 112 documents onto
this vocabulary. Migrating onto an unenforced vocabulary is how the drift got
here.
