# Governance Status

Status: co-located executable candidate — implemented and tested / not adopted.

This directory is the bounded executable candidate zone of the Pantheon Next monorepo. Co-location does not transfer governance authority, production adoption or professional truth.

## Current boundary

```text
Hermes-compatible clients -> runtime interaction
Hermes Agent              -> external execution
Pantheon implementation   -> bounded candidate persistence/projection/admission seams
Pantheon Next              -> governance and consequential status
human                      -> consequential decision
```

```text
retrieved != truth
runtime success != authorization
projection != persistence
memory != Evidence
implementation path != governed identity
```

## Current executable owners

The co-located candidate includes, among other bounded seams:

```text
canonical schema consumption and digest-verified packaged contracts
PostgreSQL/pgvector candidate persistence and retrieval
local/NAS document ingestion with declared-source/path/digest checks
Source intake and source/project-link governance
Docling/structured extraction where selected
Cockpit API, Navigation Registry, Cards and governed projections
Knowledge update preview/apply chokepoint
policy/PEP client and effect preflight contracts
capability lifecycle projection/management seams
Hermes Runs observation, launch reservation/binding and active-context bridge
Hermes context plugin candidate
issuer-signing/authentication support
runtime_observation generic envelope
```

None of these establishes target deployment, adoption, activation or real-dossier authorization.

## Phase B composition

`compose.phase-b.yaml` now contains only the current candidate service composition:

```text
pgvector
Docling
cockpit-api
Hermes Agent
```

Paperless, its gateway/ingestion binding, the Paperless-specific Hermes skill and the dedicated document-runtime observer have been retired after consumer audit.

```text
Paperless absent != document ingestion unavailable
DMS absent != source identity absent
source captured != Evidence
```

The generic local/NAS source path remains available through existing source/document owners. Obsidian is not promoted into a DMS by this removal.

## Residual compatibility

OpenWebUI is refused as a target dependency, but residual protected compatibility files are audited separately. Their repository presence does not make OpenWebUI an active architecture owner.

```text
compatibility present != selected dependency
client compatibility != governance authority
```

## Selected implementation status

```text
installation_status: not installed by Pantheon Next
activation_status: not activated
production_status: forbidden pending separate adoption
generic_source_intake: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
local_document_ingestion: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
structured_extraction: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
cockpit_projection: implemented_candidate_not_deployed
policy_chokepoint_seam: implemented_not_connected
knowledge_update_chokepoint: wired_not_connected
capability_management_slice: implemented_not_connected
hermes_runs_api_observer: implemented_candidate_not_connected
hermes_run_launch_reservation: implemented_candidate_not_connected
hermes_runs_external_binding: implemented_candidate_not_connected
hermes_active_context_bridge: implemented_candidate_not_connected
hermes_context_plugin: implemented_candidate_not_installed
human_issuer_signing: implemented_not_connected
runtime_observation_envelope: implemented_candidate
```

A green test suite proves only that these candidate contracts remain coherent in the repository.

## Adoption gates still open

```text
real Hermes deployment/adoption
reviewed restricted Hermes tool surface
live Runs/context binding proof
live target issuer registry + signed-decision round trip
production source-path permissions and rollback proof
human approval for activation
real-dossier authorization
```

## Final rule

```text
candidate implementation != adopted runtime
healthy/reachable != safe
test pass != approval
runtime receipt != Evidence
provider selected != authority transfer
```
