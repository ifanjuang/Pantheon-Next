# Haystack bounded retrieval qualification

Status: qualification lab for Pantheon issue #908. Not installed, selected, activated or adopted by default.

## Purpose

Exercise Haystack only as a replaceable implementation behind the existing `knowledge_retrieval_pipeline` Capability Slot.

Pantheon must resolve access, currentness and exact source identity before the adapter receives any material. The provider is a projection and ranking surface only.

```text
Pantheon access/currentness/source owners
        -> exact RetrievalScopeResolution
        -> this lab adapter
        -> Haystack projection + BM25 retrieval
        -> provider-neutral candidates with exact provenance
        -> runtime consumer
```

## Qualification target

Canonical pin: `implementation/qualification/external-pins.json`.

At creation of this slice:

```text
package: haystack-ai
version: 3.1.0
upstream repository: deepset-ai/haystack
release commit: 859a6eb3ac4d0bd33f069bab57fb041e3434a353
```

The release pin is qualification input, not deployment truth.

## What this slice proves

- material outside a fresh Pantheon `RetrievalScopeResolution` is rejected before projection;
- provider retrieval is filtered by exact dossier/source ref/digest/version identity;
- provider responses are post-validated against the exact resolved identity and fail closed on mismatch;
- a poisoned provider store cannot widen the accepted corpus;
- replacing a source revision removes the prior projection for this binding instance;
- deleting/revoking all resolved sources reconciles the projection to empty;
- returned candidates preserve `document_id`, `document_version_id`, dossier, source ref, digest, source version, purpose and currentness basis references;
- returned objects are provider-neutral and carry no Evidence-admission or effect-authorization claim;
- `HAYSTACK_UNSAFE_DESERIALIZATION` is refused when enabled.

## Measured comparison against current native retrieval

PR #921 adds an observation-only comparison over the existing synthetic `devis_reprise` professional corpus. Both lanes receive the same fresh Pantheon access/currentness resolution, the same three exact `(source_ref, source_digest)` identities and derivative text from the same already-ingested chunks.

Observed on Haystack Retrieval Qualification run 6, Ubuntu 24.04, PostgreSQL/pgvector 16 and Haystack 3.1.0:

- applicable labelled exact cases: 6;
- expected source present: native 6/6, Haystack 6/6;
- expected source ranked first: native 6/6, Haystack 6/6;
- top-1 quality delta: 0;
- long professional request source coverage: native 3/3, Haystack 3/3;
- CI-local median per-case query time: native 0.685 ms, Haystack 0.546 ms;
- Haystack projection of the three exact source materials: 0.583 ms.

No retrieval-quality gain is measured for Haystack on this bounded lexical slice. The small timing difference is not deployment or production-performance evidence: Haystack is an in-process `InMemoryDocumentStore`, while the native lane crosses PostgreSQL, the corpus contains only three admitted sources, and persistence/restart costs are outside this qualification.

This observation therefore does not justify selecting a Haystack binding. Native retrieval remains sufficient for the measured lexical need. Haystack remains a replaceable qualification candidate if a later demonstrated requirement needs capabilities not provided by the native lane.

## Deliberate limitations

This first slice uses only Haystack core `InMemoryDocumentStore` + `InMemoryBM25Retriever`.

It does **not** qualify:

- production persistence or restart recovery;
- embeddings, vector retrieval or reranking;
- Google Drive, NAS or Obsidian ingestion;
- Hindsight integration or documentary dual-ingestion;
- Haystack Agent, AgentTool, Hayhooks, MCP or serialized pipeline execution;
- a production Hermes transport/API binding;
- retrieval-quality superiority over Pantheon's current native hybrid path;
- a preferred or activated Haystack binding.

The `binding_instance_id` used by the adapter is operational projection identity only. It is not a Pantheon Project, dossier, Source, CapabilityBinding or authorization identity.

## Security posture

Haystack 3.1.0 exposes `HAYSTACK_UNSAFE_DESERIALIZATION` as a process-wide switch that disables deserialization protections when set to a supported truthy value. This lab explicitly refuses that posture.

```text
provider row != Pantheon Source
provider score != Evidence quality
provider filter success != authorization
retrieval success != truth
projection != persistence
lab present != binding selected
```

## Next decision

The bounded comparison does not show a retrieval-quality reason to replace or bind over the current native lexical lane. The next #908 decision should therefore review only the remaining demonstrated gaps, operational/security burden and replacement value before either keeping Haystack on candidate-watch or closing the candidate without activation.
