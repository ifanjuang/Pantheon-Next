# Pantheon MVP

> Executable candidate implementation for the Pantheon ecosystem.

[Governance repository](https://github.com/ifanjuang/Pantheon-Next) · [Pantheon runtime status](https://github.com/ifanjuang/Pantheon-Next/blob/main/docs/governance/WHAT_RUNS.md) · [Package configuration](pyproject.toml)

```text
implementation: co-located bounded candidate
adoption: not adopted
activation: not activated
production use: forbidden
```

`implementation/` implements operational candidates around PostgreSQL, APIs, Cockpit projections and adapters. It provides bounded executable workflows intended for an external Hermes-side runtime; it does not own governance or professional authority.

## System boundary

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Pantheon Next** | Canonical doctrine, schemas, status, Evidence, scope and approval boundaries. |
| **`implementation/`** | Candidate implementation, persistence, APIs, projections and integration seams. |
| **Hermes** | External task execution, tools, skills and model/runtime bindings. |
| **Pantheon Cockpit** | Governed review and projection surface. A rendered status is not authorization. |
| **Human** | Consequential validation, rejection and authorization. |

This repository may produce candidates, observations and refusals. It must not approve truth, admit Evidence automatically, promote memory, send externally, schedule work or route providers.

## Implemented candidate surfaces

- Task Contract ingestion and SQL-scoped retrieval;
- deterministic candidate and refusal paths;
- PostgreSQL / pgvector persistence;
- Work Issues, comments, Runs and append-only material events;
- Project Document and Knowledge projections;
- structured document extraction through an optional Docling binding;
- Cockpit API, mobile Markdown editor and schema-driven card navigation;
- read-only filesystem workspace projections through explicitly configured server roots;
- direct consumption of canonical Pantheon schemas, with generated copies only inside build artifacts.

The former OpenWebUI adapter package and product-specific capability routes were removed after verification that their only executable consumers were dedicated OpenWebUI tests. Native document/Knowledge APIs and Cockpit projections remain under `pantheon_app`.

Implementation does not imply installation, health, adoption, activation or production authorization.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Docker Compose.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[test,cockpit]"

docker compose up -d
pytest -q
```

Run the bounded synthetic example:

```bash
pantheon-app ingest --contract dossiers/devis_reprise/task_contract.yaml

pantheon-app run \
  --contract dossiers/devis_reprise/task_contract.yaml \
  --question "le devis correspond-il au périmètre du CCTP pour le lot 06 ?" \
  --output out/candidates.yaml
```

The runner must refuse sources and questions outside the declared Task Contract scope.

## Optional profiles

| Profile | Purpose | Status boundary |
|---|---|---|
| default | PostgreSQL + pgvector development store. | Local service availability is not adoption. |
| `documents` | Self-hosted Docling document conversion. | Extraction is derived data, not Evidence. |
| `cockpit` | API, document/knowledge surfaces and mobile editor. | UI and API success are not authorization. |

Start the Cockpit candidate with separate development credentials:

```bash
export PANTHEON_COCKPIT_API_KEY='dev-read-key'
export PANTHEON_EDITOR_API_KEY='dev-editor-key'
export PANTHEON_HERMES_API_KEY='dev-hermes-key'
export PANTHEON_DOCUMENT_ROOT='./dossiers'
export PANTHEON_WORKSPACE_ROOTS_JSON='{"ifja-agency":"/srv/vaults/IFJA-Agence","ifja-projects":"/srv/vaults/IFJA-Projets"}'

docker compose --profile cockpit up -d --build
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/health
```

`PANTHEON_WORKSPACE_ROOTS_JSON` is an optional server-owned JSON object mapping opaque workspace references to filesystem roots. The physical paths are never projected to the browser. An absent value produces an empty Workspace collection; malformed configuration or a configured root that does not exist fails closed at application composition. A projected workspace folder is navigation only: its name or location does not make it a Pantheon Project, Category, Knowledge, Evidence or authorization scope.

The document and workspace mounts are read-only from the Cockpit projection surface. Real credentials, real dossier/workspace access and runtime activation require a separate reviewed deployment decision.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`pantheon_app/`](pantheon_app/) | Python implementation, APIs, persistence and domain projections. |
| [`pantheon_app/cockpit/`](pantheon_app/cockpit/) | Cockpit frontend and projection modules. |
| [`../schemas/`](../schemas/) | Canonical Pantheon contracts consumed directly from a monorepo checkout. |
| [`pantheon_app/sql/`](pantheon_app/sql/) | Additive PostgreSQL schema and migrations. |
| [`tests/`](tests/) | Contract, boundary and acceptance tests. |
| [`dossiers/`](dossiers/) | Synthetic fixtures and Task Contracts. |
| [`tools/`](tools/) | Inventory, qualification and architecture-audit utilities. |

## Development rules

- Keep server contracts authoritative; Cockpit cards are projections.
- Use registries and schemas for editable fields, navigation, tags and statuses.
- Keep source data, derived structure, Knowledge, Evidence and UI projections distinct.
- Changes with consequences should use provenance, base revision, diff, idempotency and human review.
- Canonical root schemas remain the only version-controlled contract authority; build copies are generated distribution material only.
- Do not remove compatibility or apparently unused modules without checking imports, routes, scripts, deployments and tests.
