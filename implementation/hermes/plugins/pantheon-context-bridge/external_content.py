"""Minimal gateway attachment protection for the Pantheon context bridge.

V1 deliberately does not infer provenance or read authority from terminal text,
filesystem mutations, downloads or clones. It only protects document content that
Hermes has already surfaced as gateway attachment text before model dispatch.

Trust model, stated because the whole boundary rests on it:

```text
event.text        may contain attacker-authored document bytes
event.raw_message carries the platform message the human actually sent
```

The caption carve-out below is correct only under that split. It never copies a
slice of ``event.text`` outside the data block; it re-emits the string taken from
``raw_message``, so a mis-detected boundary can drop document bytes but can never
promote them to a user request.
