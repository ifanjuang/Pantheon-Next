"""The workflow that runs the pin guard must be triggered by everything it reads.

`test_external_qualification_pins.py` scans four roots, only two of which sit
under `implementation/`. `implementation-ci.yml` — the workflow whose "Run
remaining test suite" step actually executes it — was filtered to
`implementation/**` and `schemas/**`.

The consequence was not hypothetical. PR #1073 touched only
`deployment/ubuntu/observe-hermes-runtime` and
`tests/test_hermes_runtime_observation_script.py`; neither matched the filter,
the workflow never ran, and the guard stayed red on `main` across five
subsequent merges before anyone looked.

A guard whose reach exceeds its trigger is a control that cannot fire. This test
holds the two together: widen what the guard reads and the filter must follow.
