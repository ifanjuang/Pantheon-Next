"""Make the consequential-mutation surface enumerable instead of assumed.

`CLAUDE.md` states the invariant in the present tense:

```text
A consequential effect still routes through the governance check (the
chokepoint). No module or implementation path bypasses it.
```

Nothing verified that. `policy_gate.enforce_consequential` was imported by two
modules, so an import-graph audit reported the module as reachable and healthy,
while the parameter that triggers the call (`policy_client`) had no non-test
caller and `HttpPolicyClient` was never instantiated outside tests. Each mutation
entry point defends itself with its own local checks — signed previews,
confirmation phrases, optimistic concurrency, idempotency keys, admission state
machines — and no two of them share a guard.

That paragraph was true when it was written on 2026-08-31 and stopped being true
the next day. `4d3e99c3` wired `HttpPolicyClient` into `cockpit_shell.create_app`
from `MVP_POLICY_API_URL` / `MVP_POLICY_API_KEY`, behind a
`require_policy_client` dependency that answers 503 when enforcement is
`required` and no decision point is configured — so the Knowledge update route
fails closed, and disabling the gate is an explicitly declared value rather than
a default. `human_access.bind_oidc_identity` was wired second, on the same
arrangement.

The sentence that motivates this entire document went stale within a day, and
three passes over the entries did not catch it, because every one of them was
reading entry points and none was reading this. A record rots at its premises as
readily as at its rows.

Local defence is not the problem. The problem is that a new entry point can be
added tomorrow inheriting none of it, with no check noticing.

## Where the review stands

All ninety-two entry points have been read individually. The first batches were
chosen because nothing in production reached them — answerable without unwinding
a call graph, and the cheapest end of the backlog rather than the most urgent
one. From `knowledge.py` onward every entry point is live: each sits behind a
route a key holder can call today.

One is not: `cli.main` opens its own connection and asks for no key at all.
Recorded there, because "the write surface is behind an API key" is a true
statement about the routes and a false one about the system.

One entry point is recorded as `gate_required_not_wired` rather than softened
into `none`. `act_working_information` supersedes the acted version of a
governed Information series and records no actor.

`bind_oidc_identity`, `store_reviewed_dossier`, `publish_knowledge` and
`apply_edit_request` are now wired. `complete_edit_request` — recorded
alongside `apply_edit_request` because both write the same `status` column
with nothing to decide it — was closed by a local status guard instead: it
fixes the specific finding (a rejected request could be silently returned to
`proposed`), not a missing decision point, and needed no chokepoint call.
Two of the four wired entries share the same shape once read in order to
wire them: neither `bind_oidc_identity` nor `store_reviewed_dossier` had a
production caller at all. `bind_oidc_identity` left `human_oidc_bindings` —
the table every authenticated request resolves against — reachable only from
outside the product; `store_reviewed_dossier`
left a Project's whole Architecture Project Understanding baseline the same
way. Wiring `store_reviewed_dossier` did not have to invent a content binding:
`_normalize_dossier` already folds `review_ref` into the same structure as the
dossier it accompanies before the existing idempotency digest is computed, so
the decision expectation reuses that digest — covering this exact `review_ref`
bundled with this exact dossier, though still not verifying `review_ref`
names a review that actually happened.

## The first write of a projection was not serialised, and now is

Recorded because all three `information_projection` entries share it, and
because the first version of those records named the row lock and
`expected_revision` as effective guards without qualification.

`_metadata_row(..., lock=True)` runs `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and, when no
projection-metadata row exists yet, returns a synthetic dictionary carrying
`revision: 0`. `FOR UPDATE` locks rows, not keys: a row that does not exist
cannot be locked. So two concurrent first mutations both read revision 0, both
pass the `expected_revision` check, and both compute `resulting_revision = 1`.

For `update_projection_metadata` that is a lost update — the second
`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` overwrites every field the first wrote. For the link
paths the metadata survives, but the event log gains two events both declaring
`0 -> 1`, describing a linear history that did not happen.

The pattern is used correctly everywhere else: eleven other modules raise a
not-found error when the locked row is missing. This is the one place where the
row is optional by design, and the optional case is where the token is invented.

Closed in 552e67e7, with the repair this section proposed:
`_advance_metadata_revision` carries the expected revision into the upsert's
conflict clause and requires `rowcount == 1`. On a genuine first write exactly
one racer's INSERT succeeds; the loser conflicts, its guarded UPDATE matches
nothing, and it fails as stale instead of overwriting.

The section is kept rather than deleted. The three entries were cleared on a
lock that was not taken, and a reader of this inventory is entitled to know that
happened and how it was found.

They were then wrong in the other direction: after 552e67e7 the three entries
went on describing the race as live, and the guard lists were refreshed while the
explanations beside them were not. A record can rot toward either verdict, and
only the entry's own text says which reading is current.

## Where the actor label is strongest, and what that still is not

Six modules record an actor nobody verified. `entity_relations` is where this
codebase pushes hardest against that, and reading it clarifies the whole axis.

```text
agency_classification   _validate_actor, defaulted        a caller omits it and passes
agency_information      actor_kind literal at the route   body-proof, module still trusts it
execution_results       trigger: claim needs a human      a second Python caller cannot pass
entity_relations        CHECK: only a proposal may be     no row can say Hermes canonized
                        attributed to a non-human
```

The last is the strongest form available, and it is worth being exact about
what it buys. None of these verifies that the label is true: a caller
presenting `human` passes every one of them. What the constraint guarantees is
that the audit trail can never hold the contradiction — no stored row can say
Hermes canonized a relation.

That is internal consistency of the record. It is real, it is rare, and it is
not the same as knowing who acted. `canonize_relation`'s docstring says "Hermes
cannot reach this"; what holds is "no record can say Hermes reached this".

## The net was under-counting, and it under-counted the worst cases

The tenth batch found this by accident, reading `work_issues.py`:
`transition_issue` was not in this inventory at all. Nor were twelve others.

Discovery saw a public function only if its name began with one of five verbs
or its own body contained a literal SQL write. Neither signal sees a public
function that delegates its write to a private helper in the same module —
which is a normal way to write this codebase, and is how the following are
written:

```text
work_issues.transition_issue          the only general status move
work_issues.close_issue               the only path to done
entity_relations.canonize_relation    canonization, by name
entity_relations.reject_relation      entity_relations.retire_relation
source_intake.exclude_source          restore_source, link_project,
                                      unlink_project, update_metadata,
                                      suggest_projects
hermes_runtime_return.record_external_runtime_return
apu_cross_family.create_decision_request
```

Thirteen entry points, and the miss was not random: it fell on functions whose
names are verbs of consequence. A third signal now catches them: discovery follows calls, so a public function
counts if a write is reachable from it through any chain of named functions,
across modules included.

That signal was itself wrong twice before it was right, which is worth keeping.
The first version intersected each function's calls with *private* helpers in
its own module, and still missed `create_scoped_issue` — the entry point of
`POST /work/issues`, which delegates to two *public* functions in another
module. The second version walked whole subtrees and caught every
`install_*_routes` and `create_app` in the package, because those *define*
route handlers that call writers rather than calling writers themselves:
eighteen wiring functions, the opposite failure and just as useless. The net
that holds counts a function's own calls, nested definitions excluded, and
follows them to a fixpoint.

Worth being precise about how this instrument failed, because it is the same
failure it exists to find. Two tests guarded discovery: one asserts every
discovered entry point is declared, the other that discovery is not vacuous.
Both passed throughout. Neither could fail for something the net never saw.
**The control verified its output and never its coverage.**

## What happened to this record the day after it was written

Five of the findings above were repaired within a day — `revoke_grant`,
`record_claim`, `resolve_request`, `suggest_projects` and the Information
projection race. **None of the repairs touched this file**, so for a day the
inventory recorded three gates that were closed and two defects that were fixed,
while every test here passed.

They passed because they check that each entry point is declared and never that
the declaration is still true. That is the failure this inventory exists to
record, committed by the inventory: a record describing a state the code has
left.

`test_a_pending_gate_still_points_at_the_code_that_needs_it` is the repair, and
it is deliberately the pattern this review recommended everywhere else — the one
`apu_write_preparation.append_authorization` already uses. Each pending gate
names a literal fragment of the code that makes it pending, and the test asks
for the verdict back when that fragment goes. A verdict bound to a content, not
to a name.

## Attribution is a separate axis from authorization

Four modules now show the same split, and it is not the gate's to fix. The
authorization is verified — a key comparison, a principal lookup, a dependency
that cannot be reached from a request body. The attribution is not.

```text
agency_classification     X-Pantheon-Human-Actor   asserted, persisted as updated_by
agency_information        X-Pantheon-Actor         asserted, required, then discarded
knowledge                 created_by               a body field, persisted verbatim
knowledge_edit_variants   X-Pantheon-Human-Actor   asserted, persisted; kind is a literal
decision_requests         X-Pantheon-Human-Actor   asserted — and so is its assurance level
information_projection    X-Pantheon-Actor         asserted, persisted into the event log
hermes_execution          X-Pantheon-Human-Actor   asserted — but the key decides the side
```

The last line is the one exception found so far, and it is an exception of
authorization rather than attribution. Admission and revocation take the editor
key with a human actor; launch reservation, runtime start and result return take
the Hermes key with a Hermes actor. The name in the header is still unverified,
but no key can play both sides: Hermes cannot admit its own handoff, and a human
editor cannot forge the runtime callback.

The last line is the one that settles the question. `decision_requests` is the
only module that models the distinction: `identity_assurance` is mandatory and
takes `declared` or `authenticated`, and `authenticated` requires an
`authenticated_principal` with `user_id` and `identity_provider`. Both arrive in
the request body. So the party asserting the name also chooses the assurance
level describing that assertion, and supplies the principal said to back it.
Nothing authenticates any of it.

The concept the other four modules lack already exists here. What it lacks is a
source of truth: an assurance level is only worth what produced it.

Two are worth reading twice. All four Information routes refuse a request
without `X-Pantheon-Actor` and none of them uses the value: the parameter is
named `_actor`, and `agency_information_cards` has no actor column to put it in.
The header is enforced as though it mattered and stored nowhere.

And in `knowledge_edit_variants` the review event log — the record of who chose,
who refused and who applied — takes its `actor` from that header and its
`actor_kind` from a literal written at each of its four `_insert_event` sites,
one `system` and three `human`. Both halves of the attribution are decided by the
code path rather than observed from the caller.

## What keeps being wrong

Four of those six were first recorded as `none`, and each correction had the same
shape: a guard was believed on the strength of what it is called rather than what
it composes to.

```text
review_ref                     reads as a reference to a review
"cannot revoke access.manage"  reads as protection of the administrator
_validate_actor                reads as a refusal of Hermes
status == "proposed"           reads as a decision already taken
```

None of the four was a slip. Each was a verdict written after reading the
function, and each was wrong one call away from where the reading stopped. The
question that finds them is not "what does this check" but "who controls each
input" — asked of every link, including the ones that look settled.

## How the surface is discovered, and why not by name

A first version of this test recognised entry points by five verb prefixes —
`apply`, `admit`, `promote`, `approve`, `commit`. A review pointed out that the
docstring then claimed far more than the code delivered, and it was right: that
net caught **8** functions while **64** other public functions write to the
database directly. Widening the verb list is not the fix either — it drags in
`create_app` and `resolve_case_ref`, which mutate nothing.

Discovery is therefore the union of two signals, neither sufficient alone:

```text
structural  a public function whose body contains an INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
            statement — catches writers whatever they are called
verb        a public apply_/admit_/promote_/approve_/commit_ function — catches
            entry points that delegate their write and contain no SQL of their
            own, which the structural signal alone misses (two of the eight
            reviewed entries are exactly that)
```

This is a net, not a proof. It still cannot see a delegating entry point that is
named outside the verb list, and it does not follow the call graph. What it does
guarantee is that the surface it names is enumerated and cannot grow silently.

## What a declaration means

```text
gate = "enforce_consequential"    -> calls the Pantheon chokepoint
gate = "optional"                 -> chokepoint reachable but opt-in, default off
gate = "none"                     -> reviewed; module-local checks judged sufficient
gate = "gate_required_not_wired"  -> reviewed; the effect needs the chokepoint and
                                     does not reach it. A decision, not a defect
                                     list, and a debt that may not grow.
```

`none` is a conclusion, not an absence: it records that a human read the path and
judged its local chain sufficient. `unreviewed` is the absence. Keeping the two
apart is the whole point of this file — without the distinction, a path nobody
has looked at is indistinguishable from one that was cleared.

`local_guards` records what genuinely protects the path, so `"none"` is never
mistaken for `"unprotected"`. Entries carrying `_UNREVIEWED` are enumerated but
not yet individually read: their guard regime is *unknown*, which is recorded
honestly rather than assumed to be `"none"`. A test counts them, so the debt is
visible and shrinks deliberately.

## Two attribution mechanisms, and only one of them verifies

Reading the `agency_classification` cluster surfaced a repository-wide split that
no single entry owns.

```text
principal.principal_ref     35 sites   an authenticated principal context
X-Pantheon-Human-Actor      19 route dependencies across 8 modules
```

The second is a request header. `require_human_actor` is named like an
authentication check and composes to: read the header, require it non-empty.
Nothing ties the named human to a governed principal or to the party presenting
the bearer key — and the value is persisted into governed rows as `updated_by`.

So on those routes the *authorization* is verified (the bearer key) while the
*attribution* is asserted. The chokepoint would not repair that; binding the
actor to an authenticated identity would. It is recorded here because it is the
third instance in this file of the same failure shape, and the one with the
widest reach.

```text
import edge != call path
module reachable != gate invoked
local guard != central chokepoint
enumerated != reviewed
declared inventory != wired chokepoint
```

Adding an entry point without declaring it fails closed. Recording `_UNREVIEWED`
is a permitted, honest answer; recording nothing is not.

    Four entries in this inventory went stale within a day. `revoke_grant`,
    `record_claim` and `resolve_request` had their gaps closed in code while
    their records still read `gate_required_not_wired`, and the entries for
    `suggest_projects` and the Information projection still described defects
    that had been repaired. Every test here passed throughout, because they
    check that each entry point is declared and never that the declaration is
    still true.

    That is the failure this inventory exists to record, committed by the
    inventory. The repair is the pattern the review found in
    `apu_write_preparation.append_authorization` and recommended everywhere
    else: bind the record to the thing it describes.

    The first version of this test bound each verdict to a literal fragment the
    entry point contains, and got the polarity wrong. `gate_required_not_wired`
    is a claim about what the code does *not* do, and a fragment the function
    keeps — its `def` line, a parameter name, a check it already performs —
    survives the repair. Wiring the gate into `bind_oidc_identity` would have
    left `def bind_oidc_identity(` exactly where it was and this test green:
    the anchor proved the function still existed, which was never in doubt.
    That is the same mistake the review kept finding in the code — a guard
    asserted from what something is named rather than from what it composes to
    — committed one more time, in the test written to stop it.

    So assert the absence instead, twice over. The gate must still not be
    reachable from the entry point, which fails the moment someone wires it.
    And the function's body, normalized through the parser, must still digest to
    what was read when the verdict was taken, which fails for a repair made by
    any other means — validating the `review_ref`, guarding the status, taking
    the actor. Either failure asks the same question: this was recorded as
    unguarded, the code has moved, is the verdict still true?

    A body that moves for an unrelated reason is a false alarm, and that is the
    intended cost: re-reading six known-defective functions is cheaper than a
    governance record nobody can trust.
