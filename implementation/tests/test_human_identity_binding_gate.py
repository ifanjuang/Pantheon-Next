"""The chokepoint on the act that makes an external identity a governed principal.

`bind_oidc_identity` writes the row `resolve_principal_context` resolves every
authenticated request against. It is the root of trust for the whole principal
regime, and until now nothing in production called it at all.

It is not authorized by a grant, and that is deliberate rather than missing:
`033_human_project_access_management.sql` states that `project.access.manage`
carries no IdP invitation authority and remains a locally provisioned bootstrap
capability, and `human_resource_grants.project_id` is NOT NULL against
`agency_projects`, so the table cannot express a system-wide permission. A
project-scoped grant minting a system-wide identity would be an escalation.

So the authority is the chokepoint, and the decision must cover the exact
binding rather than name it.
